# OmniTrade AI - Production Architecture

## System Overview

A production-grade automated trading system with multi-broker support, AI-driven strategies, and comprehensive risk management.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Core Services

- **Trading Engine**: Order execution, position management, risk controls
- **Strategy Engine**: Multi-strategy orchestration with AI optimization
- **Data Aggregator**: Real-time market data, news, sentiment analysis
- **Risk Manager**: Position sizing, stop-loss, drawdown protection
- **Portfolio Manager**: Multi-asset portfolio tracking and rebalancing
- **Alert System**: Real-time notifications for trades and risk events

### 2. Data Layer

- **PostgreSQL**: User accounts, trade history, strategy configurations
- **InfluxDB**: Time-series market data, performance metrics
- **Redis**: Real-time caching, session management, rate limiting

### 3. Integration Layer

- **Broker APIs**: Alpaca (stocks), Binance (crypto), Interactive Brokers
- **Market Data**: Real-time price feeds, order book data
- **News APIs**: Financial news aggregation and sentiment analysis
- **Economic Calendar**: FOMC, earnings, economic indicators

### 4. AI/ML Components

- **Technical Analysis Engine**: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: NLP for news and social media
- **Pattern Recognition**: ML models for price patterns
- **Strategy Optimizer**: Reinforcement learning for parameter tuning

### 5. Security & Compliance

- **Authentication**: JWT tokens, 2FA support
- **API Key Management**: Encrypted storage with AWS KMS or HashiCorp Vault
- **Audit Logging**: Complete trade and system event logging
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against API abuse

### 6. Monitoring & Observability

- **Health Checks**: System component monitoring
- **Performance Metrics**: Trade execution, latency, success rates
- **Alerting**: Email, SMS, Telegram notifications
- **Dashboard**: Real-time system status and performance

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Framework**: FastAPI (high-performance async)
- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **AI/ML**: PyTorch, scikit-learn, OpenAI API
- **Trading Libraries**: ccxt (crypto), alpaca-py (stocks)

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React + Next.js
- **UI Library**: TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui
- **Charts**: Recharts, TradingView widgets
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connections

### Infrastructure
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (optional for scale)
- **Cloud**: AWS/GCP or self-hosted
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: MVP (Current)
- Single broker integration (Alpaca for stocks, Binance for crypto)
- 5 core strategies (trend following, mean reversion, breakout, momentum, sentiment)
- Basic risk management (stop-loss, position sizing)
- Web dashboard with manual controls

### Phase 2: Production Enhancement
- Multi-broker support
- Advanced AI strategies with ML optimization
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Backtesting framework

### Phase 3: Full Autonomy
- Reinforcement learning agent
- Multi-asset portfolio optimization
- Global data integration (news, social, macro)
- Advanced risk models (VaR, stress testing)

## Risk Management Framework

### Position Limits
- Max position size per trade: 2-5% of portfolio
- Max total exposure: 80% of portfolio
- Max leverage: User-configurable (default 1x)

### Stop-Loss Rules
- Hard stop-loss: 1-3% per trade
- Trailing stop: Dynamic based on volatility
- Time-based exit: Close positions after N days

### Circuit Breakers
- Daily loss limit: Halt trading after X% drawdown
- Consecutive loss limit: Pause after N losing trades
- Volatility filter: Reduce position size in high volatility

### Risk Monitoring
- Real-time P&L tracking
- Portfolio heat map
- Correlation analysis
- Drawdown alerts

## Security Considerations

### API Key Storage
- Never store keys in code or config files
- Use environment variables or secure vaults
- Encrypt keys at rest
- Rotate keys periodically

### Access Control
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API rate limiting
- IP whitelisting (optional)
- Audit logging for all actions

### Data Protection
- SSL/TLS for all communications
- Encrypted database connections
- PII data encryption
- GDPR compliance

## Operational Procedures

### Startup Sequence
1. Load configuration and validate
2. Initialize database connections
3. Authenticate with broker APIs
4. Start market data feeds
5. Initialize strategy engines
6. Enable trading (manual approval)

### Shutdown Sequence
1. Stop accepting new signals
2. Close all open positions (optional)
3. Flush logs and metrics
4. Disconnect from APIs
5. Graceful shutdown

### Error Handling
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Fallback to alternative data sources
- Alert on critical errors
- Automatic position closure on system failure

## Monitoring & Alerts

### System Health
- API connectivity status
- Database connection pool
- Memory and CPU usage
- Latency metrics

### Trading Performance
- Win rate and profit factor
- Sharpe ratio and max drawdown
- Daily/weekly/monthly P&L
- Strategy-level performance

### Risk Alerts
- Position size violations
- Stop-loss triggers
- Daily loss limit breaches
- Unusual market conditions

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless API servers
- Load balancing across instances
- Distributed task queue (Celery)

### Vertical Scaling
- Optimize database queries
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Async I/O for API calls

### Data Management
- Time-series data retention policies
- Archive old trade data
- Efficient indexing strategies

## Security Measures

### Current Implementation

‚úÖ **Environment Variable Storage**: API keys stored in environment variables  
‚úÖ **Logging**: Comprehensive audit logging of all trades  
‚úÖ **Risk Management**: Circuit breakers and position limits  
‚úÖ **Input Validation**: Pydantic models for request validation  
‚úÖ **CORS Configuration**: Configurable CORS origins  

### Recommended Additional Measures

üî≤ **Authentication**: Implement API key or JWT authentication (HIGH PRIORITY)  
üî≤ **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to prevent abuse  
üî≤ **Secrets Encryption**: Encrypt API keys at rest  
üî≤ **2FA**: Two-factor authentication for live trading  
üî≤ **IP Whitelisting**: Restrict API access by IP  
üî≤ **Security Scanning**: Regular vulnerability scans

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Before Deployment

1. **Change All Default Credentials**
   - Generate new `SECRET_KEY` with: `openssl rand -hex 32`
   - Use strong, unique passwords for databases

2. **Use Paper Trading First**
   - ALWAYS test with paper trading accounts
   - Verify all functionality before going live
   - Monitor for at least 1 week

3. **Secure Your Server**
   - Use firewall (UFW on Ubuntu)
   - Enable SSH key authentication only
   - Keep system updated
   - Use HTTPS (Let's Encrypt)

4. **API Key Security**
   - Never commit `.env` file to version control
   - Use read-only API keys where possible
   - Enable IP whitelisting on broker accounts
   - Rotate keys regularly (every 90 days)

5. **Network Security**
   - Use VPN for production access
   - Restrict access to known IPs only
   - Monitor access logs

### During Operation

1. **Monitor Continuously**
   - Check logs daily
   - Set up alerts for unusual activity
   - Review trades regularly

2. **Limit Exposure**
   - Start with small amounts
   - Use conservative risk parameters
   - Keep majority of funds offline

3. **Backup Regularly**
   - Backup configuration daily
   - Backup trade data weekly
   - Test restore procedures

4. **Update Promptly**
   - Apply security patches immediately
   - Subscribe to security notifications
   - Review changelogs before updating

### Emergency Procedures

1. **Suspected Breach**
   - Stop trading engine immediately
   - Rotate all API keys
   - Change all passwords
   - Review access logs
   - Close all open positions

2. **System Compromise**
   - Disconnect from internet
   - Preserve logs for analysis
   - Restore from clean backup
   - Report to broker

3. **Data Loss**
   - Stop all services
   - Restore from latest backup
   - Reconcile with broker statements
   - Document incident

## Known Security Considerations

### API Key Storage

**Current**: Stored in plaintext in `.env` file  
**Risk**: If file is accessed, keys are compromised  
**Mitigation**: Use file system permissions (600), consider encryption  

### Broker API Access

**Current**: Direct API calls with stored credentials  
**Risk**: Credential leakage, replay attacks  
**Mitigation**: Use short-lived tokens, implement request signing  

### Web Interface (if deployed)

**Current**: No authentication on API endpoints  
**Risk**: Anyone with URL can execute trades  
**Mitigation**: Implement authentication IMMEDIATELY before web deployment  

### Logging

**Current**: Detailed logging including prices and quantities  
**Risk**: Logs may contain sensitive information  
**Mitigation**: Secure log files, rotate regularly, consider log encryption  

### Database

**Current**: PostgreSQL with basic authentication  
**Risk**: SQL injection (mitigated by ORM), unauthorized access  
**Mitigation**: Use strong passwords, enable SSL, restrict network access
